            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) forms the backbone of every
            website, defining its structure and content. I use it to create

            appealing, mobile-friendly, and consistent across different browsers
            and screen sizes for every user.

            overall experience and ensuring websites respond effectively to
            visitors’ needs in real time.
